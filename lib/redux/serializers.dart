/// Example of how to use built_value serialization.
///
/// Declare a top level [Serializers] field called serializers. Annotate it
/// with [SerializersFor] and provide a `const` `List` of types you want to
/// be serializable.
///
/// The built_value code generator will provide the implementation. It will
/// contain serializers for all the types asked for explicitly plus all the
/// types needed transitively via fields.
///
/// You usually only need to do this once per project.
